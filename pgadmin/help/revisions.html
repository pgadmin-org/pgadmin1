<h1>pgAdmin Revision History</h1>

<p>Key to contributors:</p>

<p>DP - Dave Page<br>
RC - Rod Childers<br>
KR - Kirk Roybal<br>
JMP - Jean-Michel Poure</p>
<h4>v7.1.1 Fixes/Updates</h4>
<ul>
  <li>(DP) ADO connection objects used by the Migration Wizard now have the UID/PWD
    set directly *and* in the connection string to ensure they are picked up by
    ODBC drivers that manage to ignore one or the other (appears to occur with
    SQL Server and Oracle whilst PostgreSQL, Access and Informix seem OK).</li>
  <li>(DP) Fixed a bug that caused the DataGrid to report all Boolean values in
    the first row as being False.</li>
  <li>(DP) Added quotes around objects names in the SQL used to refresh the Sequence &amp; Table caches (Bug #196)</li>
  <li>(KR) Added 'Serialize Column' option to table browser. This option allows
    columns of suitable types (ie. int, float etc.) to be converted to
    pseudo-serial columns.</li>
  <li>(DP) The New DSN dialogue now clears the list of DSN in the Login Dialogue
    correctly after creating a new DSN (Bug #193).</li>
  <li>(DP) Added a Getting Started guide from francl with contributions from
    Jean-Michel Poure.</li>
  <li>(DP) Fixed DSN create failed bug
    (pgAdmin incorrectly reported that the first DSN created on a machine
    failed) (Bug #194).</li>
  <li>(DP) Table and Index reports now show variable length columns as 'Variable' not
    '0' (Bug #203).</li>
  <li>(DP) Fixed a bug that prevented the display of column details for many
    numeric columns.</li>
  <li>(DP) Fixed a bug in the SQL wizard that caused an extra , to be included
    in the SQL if only only table was selected.</li>
  <li>(DP) Added a Custom Reports guide.</li>
  <li>(DP) Fixed a bug where the Revision Tracking Version number could get
    misinterpreted in some locales (Bug #241).</li>
  <li>(DP) Fixed a bug in the Migration Wizard where the MDB file
    username/password fields were used when the ODBC username/password fields
    should have been (thanks to Ted Arnold).</li>
  <li>(JMP) Modified frmODBCLogon to allow use of the PostgreSQL ODBC+ Driver.</li>
  <li>(DP) Added an Auto highlighting/colouring textbox control to various forms
    (contributed by Mark Yeatman).</li>
  <li>(JMP) Mods to the Migration Wizard for more reliable non-English language
    use.</li>
  <li>(DP) Allow Migration from Views.</li>
  <li>(DP) Fixed bug where Inherited tables in Table Creator are referenced by 
  OID, not name. (Bug #257).</li>
</ul>
<h4>v7.1.0 Fixes/Updates</h4>
<ul>
  <li>(RC) Added 'Migrate Primary Keys' code to the Migration Wizard.</li>
  <li>(DP) Fixed a bug where system comments were migrated from pg_description
    as well as user comments.</li>
  <li>(DP) System generated Referential Integrity (foreign key) triggers are now
    hidden from the Trigger Browser unless 'Show System Triggers' is checked.</li>
  <li>(DP) Foreign Keys, Primary Keys, Check Constraints and Unique Constraints
    are now listed in the Table Browser alongside the table columns.</li>
  <li>(DP) Allow viewing of the ACL on Sequences and Views</li>
  <li>(DP) Allow Views to be selected in the Privileges Dialogue.</li>
  <li>(RC) Changed default datatype for VarChar and VarWChar to the PostgreSQL
    varchar type in the Type Map used by the Migration Wizard.</li>
  <li>(DP) Added code to auto upgrade Server Side Objects (SSO's) if they have
    been updated.</li>
  <li>(DP) Grant All permissions to Public on pgadmin_* views so all users can
    use them.</li>
  <li>(RC) Foreign Keys can now be migrated in the Migration Wizard.</li>
  <li>(DP) Fixed a bug in the scrolling log window which caused a blank line to
    be shown at the bottom.</li>
  <li>(DP) Fixed a bug in the Table and Index browsers that could make the info
    frames appear to flash as objects were selected in the treeview.</li>
  <li>(DP) Added options to the Database browser to create User and System DSNs
    for the selected database.</li>
  <li>(RC) Fixed a bug which could caused indexes to be duplicated or created
    for non-existent tables in the Migration Wizard.</li>
  <li>(DP) Rebuilt libpq.dll &amp; psql.exe from the 7.1 source. Used /MD linker
    flag to prevent psql.exe from dying horribly when redisplaying the prompt
    after a &lt;CR&gt;.</li>
  <li>(RC) Fixed a bug where the Migration Wizard would fail if a Date/Time
    field in Access was being migrated to a Date column in PostgreSQL and only a
    time was present. This occurs because Access uses Date/Time fields for dates
    and/*or* times.</li>
  <li>(DP) Assume all pg_* objects are System Object regardless of their OID.
    This primarily hides Toast related objects but should also hide other future
    system objects (assuming the PostgreSQL team continue using a pg_ prefix).</li>
  <li>(DP) Fixed a bug preventing changes to the Type Map settings being
    reloaded from the registry on Windows 95.</li>
  <li>(DP) Added Outer Join support to the SQL wizard.</li>
  <li>(RC) Allow the Migration Wizard to return to step 1 after Migration has
    competed.</li>
  <li>(DP) Removed the DataGrid which would not update data in tables with
    uppercase characters in column names (caused by ADO). The new Grid is based
    on the original code but is integrated directly into pgAdmin, and does query
    based updates as required whilst maintaining the correct data in the grid
    without refreshing a recordset. Unlike ADO, this code will allow you to drop
    or&nbsp; update multiple rows if the selected row cannot be uniquely
    identified. Queries used to select data are parsed to determine whether the
    data can updated and options are given accordingly.</li>
  <li>(DP) Updated to check for views with pg_class.relkind = 'v'.</li>
  <li>(DP) Prevented the Migration Wizard from Migrating varchar fields of
    excessive size (8088).</li>
  <li>(DP) Fixed a bug in the CREATE TABLE dialogue which prevented re-adding a
    serial column if one was deleted, or if a CREATE TABLE operation with a
    serial column was aborted.</li>
  <li>(DP) Added code to ensure that only superusers can create or drop Server
    Side Objects.</li>
</ul>
<h4>v7.0.5 Fixes/Updates</h4>
<ul>
  <li>(DP) Fixed the 'may not be called in a transaction block' bug which was
    overlooked in the Change Password dialogue.</li>
  <li>(DP) Fixed a bug in the new Data Grid which prevented added new records to an
    empty table or query resultset.</li>
  <li>(DP) Changed date format used in SQL queries to ISO-8601 format (eg.
    '2000-12-25 23:59:59-01') rather than Windows 'Long Date' which isn't
    understood by PostgreSQL in some locales.</li>
  <li>(DP) Fixed a bug which distorted the splash screen if 'Large Fonts' are in use.</li>
  <li>(DP) Fixed the label on the About Box which did not show the pgAdmin version
    number.</li>
  <li>(DP) Fixed an error message that reported the lowest supported version of
    PostgreSQL incorrectly.</li>
  <li>(DP) Fixed Migration of data containing ' characters in the Migration Wizard.</li>
  <li>(DP) Added options to the Migration Wizard to convert object names to lower
    case.</li>
  <li>(DP) Added error handling to the Migration Wizard to allow it to skip tables
    where permissions do not allow the user to view the column details of the
    source table.</li>
  <li>(DP) Fixed a bug where if the save button is pressed on an unchanged record in
    the data grid control, the control crashed.</li>
  <li>(DP) User defined column widths are retained between Add/Edit operations in the
    data grid control.</li>
  <li>(DP) The data grid no longer refreshes after every update operation. This
    prevents the grid scrolling back to row 1 after every edit/delete, but a row
    may only be edited once now without a manual refresh (which does scroll to
    row 1), for which a button has been added.</li>
  <li>(DP) Updated the Copyright notices to 1998 - 2001</li>
  <li>(DP) Fixed the tab order on the Add Column dialogue.</li>
  <li>(DP) Allow setting of Privileges on Sequences in the Privilege dialogue.</li>
  <li>(DP) Fixed the code in the Add Column dialogue which failed to set NOT NULL and
    DEFAULT ??? due to syntax problems.</li>
  <li>(DP) Removed old 'Open Maximised' code which caused some odd behaviour when
    opening some dialogues.</li>
  <li>(DP) Added Context Sensitive menus (right click menus) to most list boxes and
    treeviews.</li>
  <li>(DP) Updated the Installer Merge modules to match the current service pack
    level of Visual Studio. This fixes a problem that prevents the viewing of
    more than one report without a program restart on some systems.</li>
  <li>(DP) Overhauled User and Group dialogues to remove the FlexGrid control that
    was used in them. Group modification is now performed from the Group
    dialogue.</li>
  <li>(DP) Removed the vsError control that provided error logging and incorporated a
    more simple version of the same code directly into pgAdmin which produces
    slightly smaller logfiles..</li>
  <li>(DP) Added a DEVELOPMENT flag to denote whether the current version is a
    Development or Release version.</li>
  <li>(DP) Completely overhauled the Privileges Dialogue. It is now easier to see
    existing privileges, and multiple different privileges can now be set on
    multiple classes for multiple users and or groups in one operation.</li>
  <li>(DP) Added a VACUUM ANALYZE menu option/button.</li>
  <li>(DP) Added a check to the Migration Wizard to prevent attempts to create a
    field defined as varchar(0) or char(0).</li>
  <li>(DP) Changed the datatype of the record counter in the Migration Wizard to Long
    from Integer as on 32768 records could be migrated in any one table.</li>
</ul>
<h4>v7.0.4 Fixes/Updates</h4>
<ul>
  <li>(DP) Fixed the error handling in the MDIForm_Load sub in frmMain which failed
    to reset the mouse pointer to an arrow if an error occured.</li>
  <li>(DP) Added self-repair code to fix the data in pgadmin_param if it becomes
    corrupt.</li>
  <li>(DP) Updated the installation package to remove unused Crystal Reports DLLs
    from the distribution.</li>
  <li>(DP) Added code to correctly handle missing, corrupt or just plain broken
    Exporter modules.</li>
  <li>(DP) Combined the view table/view and SQL output datagrid forms and replaced
    the Microsoft grid with a replacement with improved data editing facilities.</li>
  <li>(DP) Fixed a bug in the Modify Group dialogue that prevented the data being
    loaded correctly.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>(DP) Added an Options dialogue, initially with options for Advanced Logging,
    Mask Password in Logs and Log path/filename.</li>
  <li>(DP) Fixed a bug in the CREATE TRIGGER dialogue which caused the second quote
    around the procedure name to be in the wrong place.</li>
  <li>(DP) Applied a workaround to the 'may not be called in a transaction block'
    problem which affected USER and DATABASE queries on PostgreSQL 7.0.x (thanks
    to Laszlo Kohl).</li>
  <li>(DP) pgAdmin will only run on PostgreSQL v7.0.x now. This has been the case
    since v7.0.3 but pgAdmin (and us developers!) only recently became aware of
    that fact!</li>
  <li>(DP) Added code to auto scroll the log view window after startup.</li>
  <li>(DP) Fixed the Excel Exporter which was seriously broken (to the extent that it
    didn't export at all!).</li>
</ul>
<h4>v7.0.3 Fixes/Updates</h4>
<ul>
  <li>(DP) Added an ASCII Text exporter with 'Text Substitution' map.</li>
  <li>(DP) Resized most of the controls in the browser dialogues.</li>
  <li>(DP) Improved the file handling in the SQL dialogue.</li>
  <li>(DP) Added 'Show System...' check boxes to browser dialogues that didn't
    already have one.</li>
  <li>(DP) pgAdmin database objects are now hidden by default.</li>
  <li>(DP) Re-wrote the reporting system. Reports are now generated from Views that
    are created by pgAdmin (rather than the previous local cache system). A
    report manager allows reports to be browsed and viewed, and allows the end
    user to add their own reports written using Seagate Crystal Reports v8 or
    earlier.</li>
  <li>(DP) Overhauled the Migration Wizard to remove the dependency on the old DAO
    technology and use ADOX instead. Default value migration is no longer an
    option, and indexes are only migrated from .MDB files now, but the Wizard
    seems to be more reliable and a little quicker, and the download size has
    been reduced!!</li>
  <li>(DP) Reviewed and tidied all error trapping code.</li>
  <li>(DP) Overhauled each of the Object Browsers so they now use the views that are
    created for the Reporting System.</li>
  <li>(DP) Standardised all internal SQL queries to make use of the pgadmin_* views.</li>
  <li>(DP) Added a 'Load Query' button to the 'Add View' dialogue.</li>
  <li>(DP) Removed the Export Wizard.</li>
  <li>(DP) Added a 'New DSN' option to the login dialogue to allow quick creation of
    new User and System DSNs</li>
  <li>(DP) Removed the pgadmin_sys table and replaced it with pgadmin_param which has
    a much more sensible format.</li>
  <li>(DP) The Revision Log has moved from pgadmin_log to pgadmin_rev_log which is
    timestamped by the servernot the client.</li>
  <li>(DP) Added self repair/upgrade for the server side objects.</li>
  <li>(DP) The Login Dialogue now only lists PostgreSQL datasources</li>
  <li>(DP) The Source code is now distributed separately in pgadmin-src-7_0_3.zip
    which is available from <a href="http://www.greatbridge.org/project/pgadmin/">http://www.greatbridge.org/project/pgadmin/</a></li>
</ul>
<h4>v7.0.2 Fixes/Updates</h4>
<ul>
  <li>(DP) Fixed a bug in the import wizard that limited the number of imported records to 32767</li>
  <li>(DP) Fixed a bug in the Import Wizard where tab 2 showed by default.</li>
  <li>(DP) The Import Wizard Dialogue now only automatically closes after a successful data import.</li>
  <li>(DP) Fixed a bug in the Import Wizard where when processing quoted and delimited data, if the delimiter appeared within a field, that character would be ignored.</li>
  <li>(DP) Fixed a bug in the 'View Data' dialogue that prevented addition of a new record to an empty table (Andrea
    Aime).</li>
  <li>(DP) Fixed an error with the access keys on the Table Browser.</li>
  <li>(DP) pgAdmin is now released under Gnu Public License (GPL).</li>
</ul>
<h4>v7.0.1 Fixes/Updates</h4>
<ul>
  <li>(DP) 
    <b>Open Source </b>- Yes, pgAdmin is open source as of
    v7.0.1. Please feel free to criticize my programming style (bearing in mind
    that I'm not a programmer of course!) and
    submit patches/changes to <a href="mailto:support@vale-housing.co.uk">support@vale-housing.co.uk</a></li>
  <li>(DP) Modified the Installer to allow selection of the installation directory
    (default is now C:\Program Files\pgAdmin).</li>
  <li>(DP) Altered the datatype of the functions.function field in the report cache
    database to memo to accommodate large plpgsql functions.</li>
  <li>(DP) Fixed a bizarre bug in the reports whereby memo fields (comments etc.)
    didn't print because Jet was defaulting to server side cursors instead of
    client side!</li>
  <li>(DP) Updated the Migration Wizard for use with Access 2000 Unicode databases.</li>
  <li>(DP) Updated the psql launcher to use v7.0.0 options and added a debug switch
    (equivalent to -E).</li>
  <li>(DP) Added psql.exe and libpq.dll to the distribution.</li>
  <li>(DP) Fixed quoting errors in the Create User and Modify User dialogues.</li>
  <li>(DP) Fixed the Permissions dialogue so Index relations are not listed.</li>
  <li>(DP) Added the option to specify a group when creating a new user.</li>
  <li>(DP) Fixed a bug in the Migration Wizard that tried to rollback a transaction
    in the event of an error, even if a transaction had not been started.</li>
  <li>(DP) Stopped the Migration Wizard from listing every INSERT query in the log
    view window. This change equates to a 20x increase in speed of data
    migration (on my system, with BIBLIO.mdb)!!</li>
  <li>(DP) Added a 'fallback' datatype of 'text' to the Migration Wizard.</li>
</ul>
<h4>v7.0.0 Fixes/Updates</h4>
<ul>
  <li>(DP) Updated for use with PostgreSQL v7.0.0 AND v6.5.x</li>
  <li>(DP) Now tested for use on Windows 2000.</li>
  <li>(DP) New splash screen and logo courtesy of <a href="mailto:max@lpk-computers.co.uk">Max</a>
    at <a href="http://www.lpk-computers.co.uk">LPK Design</a>.</li>
  <li>(DP) Added support for creating a 'pseudo-serial' column on a new table.</li>
  <li>(DP) Updated the graphical design of the Import, Export and Migration Wizards.</li>
  <li>(DP) Added a 'Log View' text box next to the 'SQL View' that displays the last
    32K of log entries.</li>
  <li>(DP) It is now possible to open multiple SQL dialogues.</li>
  <li>(DP) Added an 'SQL Wizard' to assist in building SELECT queries in the SQL
    dialogues.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>(DP) Fixed bugs in the 'Rename Table' and 'Rename Column' code that attempted
    to rename even if the same name or a blank name was specified.</li>
  <li>(DP) Added a 'View Data' button to the View Browser.</li>
  <li>(DP) Fixed a bug where table data could not be viewed if the table name was
    mixed case or contained a space.</li>
  <li>(DP) In the View Data window the data can now be sorted by clicking a column
    header.</li>
  <li>(DP) Support for table constraints including UNIQUE, CHECK, PRIMARY KEY &amp;
    FOREIGN KEY.</li>
  <li>(DP) Fixed numerous 'bugettes' in the table/index browsers and user manager
    where it was assumed that the driver 'Bools As Char' option was set.</li>
  <li>(DP) Removed some irrelevant info fields from the table/index browsers.</li>
  <li>(DP) The Button Bar can now be 'docked' on either the left or right side of the
    main window and the SQL Pane at either the top or bottom of the main screen.</li>
  <li>(DP) Fixed a bug in the table browser where SELECT count(*) was attempted on
    pg_log, pg_variable and pg_xactlock if selected.</li>
  <li>(DP) Added Trigger and Function Reports.</li>
  <li>(DP) Fixed a bug in the Migration Wizard that prevented backslashes in data
    being migrated.</li>
  <li>(DP) Updated the vsAdoSelector control as the previous build would not work on
    a very small number of machines.</li>
  <li>(DP) Added support for 'Plugin Exporters' to the SQL Output and View Data
    dialogues:
    <ul>
      <li>(DP) Added an Exporter Manager dialogue to add remove and view the
        installed exporters.</li>
      <li>(DP) Added 'OLE Link to Excel' and 'Basic HTML' exporters.</li>
      <li>(DP) Included the source code to the Basic HTML exporter as an example for
        other developers.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>(DP) Altered the Button Bar so that the text colour is the Active Titlebar Text
    colour and not permanently white.</li>
  <li>(DP) Fixed the form resize code on numerous dialogues that gave an error if
    they were maximised.</li>
</ul>
<h4>v6.5.5 Fixes/Updates</h4>
<ul>
  <li>(DP) Fixed a bug which prevented any data sources being available under Windows
    NT.</li>
  <li>(DP) Installation is now handled by the Windows Installer.</li>
</ul>
<h4>v6.5.4 Fixes/Updates</h4>
<ul>
  <li>(DP) Redesigned the reporting system. Reports are now generated from a local
    cache database which stores schema data gathered from the database. The
    local database is designed be easily reported from using any reporting tools
    that can access a .mdb file (Microsoft Access). There are built in standard
    reports for each of the main object types (tables, indexes functions etc.)</li>
  <li>(DP) Object comments are now cached upon first access (and re-cached when
    updated) to reduce delay when selecting different objects. This caching
    method also hugely decreases the number of SQL queries sent to the backend.</li>
  <li>(DP) DSN, username and password can now be specified on the command line.
    Syntax: <i>pgadmin [datasource username password]</i>
  If all three are specified, an autologon will be attempted,
  otherwise, values for DSN and (optionally) username will be used as defaults
  in the logon dialogue.  <li>(DP) 
    Rows can now be added, deleted and edited from the table data view window.</li>
  <li>(DP) Object comments are now migrated on first use to a new
    pgadmin_desc table which will survive a dump/reload. Comments for system
    objects are still stored in pg_description.</li>
  <li>(DP) The DataSource Name is now displayed in the title of the
    main window (and hence the taskbar button as well).</li>
  <li>(DP) Added a menu option &amp; button to open the 32Bit ODBC
    Data Source Manager.</li>
  <li>(DP) Added a 'Quick SQL' button to the bottom of the main form
    to open the arbitrary SQL dialogue.</li>
</ul>
<h4>v6.5.3 Fixes/Updates</h4>
<ul>
  <li>(DP) Fixed the row count in the Table Browser which often read 1000 unless the
    database was vacuumed.</li>
  <li>(DP) Increased the allowed rows before a warning is issued when viewing table
    data to 1000.</li>
  <li>(DP) Removed all requirements for the pgadmin_version view which was used prior
    to v6.5.2.</li>
  <li>(DP) Fixed an error where an attempt to get the revision tracking version was
    made even if the tracking log table (pgadmin_log) did not exist.</li>
  <li>(DP) Standardized all custom OCX's and pgAdmin on version 2.1 of Microsoft's
    ActiveX Data Objects Library (ADO).</li>
  <li>(DP) Fixed the row count in the Tables report.</li>
  <li>(DP) Fixed a logging problem in the reports.</li>
</ul>
<h4>v6.5.2 Fixes/Updates</h4>
<ul>
  <li>(DP) Fixed the brain dead ODBC connection checking that was called after the
    connection was used!</li>
  <li>(DP) Fixed the tooltip text on the Add Column button in the table browser.</li>
  <li>(DP) Fixed a problem where an error was generated when the MDI form was
    minimised.</li>
  <li>(DP) Converted the entire project to use ADO instead of DAO (except the source
    db side of the Migration Wizard). This is a significantly faster data access
    method.</li>
  <li>(DP) Fixed a bug in the Revision Tracker which stored the version number as an
    integer value.</li>
  <li>(DP) Changed the default type mapping for dbCurrency, dbDecimal, dbNumeric,
    dbSingle and dbDouble to the numeric data type.</li>
  <li>(DP) Database originating error messages now include the error from the
    PostgreSQL backend rather than just saying 'ODBC call failed'.</li>
  <li>(DP) Removed the Edit/Save/Cancel buttons on the Revision Tracking and Tune db
    dialogues.</li>
  <li>(DP) Increased the height of the textboxes displaying object details on the
    right hand side of the various object browsers.</li>
  <li>(DP) Added various printed reports (Summary, Tables, Indexes, Sequences).</li>
  <li>(DP) Added a Change Password dialogue.</li>
  <li>(DP) Added a Select Printer dialogue.</li>
  <li>(DP) Corrected some inconsistencies in the date handling of user account expiry
    data.</li>
  <li>(DP) Added support for the Numeric data type.</li>
  <li>(DP) Added support for User Groups.</li>
</ul>
<h4>v6.5.1 Fixes/Updates</h4>
<ul>
  <li>(DP) Modified the Create Function dialogue so It no longer assumes that only
    functions written in&nbsp; SQL don't have an object library (e.g. plpgsql).</li>
  <li>(DP) Added an SQL Pane to display SQL queries as they are built and executed.</li>
  <li>(DP) Modified the error handling (again!) to display the function in which any
    error occured.</li>
</ul>
<h4>v6.5.0 Fixes/Updates</h4>
<ul>
  <li>(DP) Modified the logon dialogue so that it now remembers the last
          username you used. For the first use, the default is the Windows
          username shifted to lowercase.</li>
  <li>(DP) Modified the Create Trigger dialogue to only allow the creation of
          triggers on tables owned by the current user.</li>
  <li>(DP) Views can no longer be seen in the Table Browser or anywhere else
          where table names are listed.</li>
  <li>(DP) Fixed a bug where Null Descriptions for object could cause an error.</li>
  <li>(DP) Add View browser and creation dialogues.</li>
  <li>(DP) Fixed a bug where access to modify/create users could be denied for
          all accounts if the ODBC driver Bools As Char option was not set.</li>
  <li>(DP) Changed the Migration Wizard's Type Map defaults for dbNumeric dbSingle, dbDouble to float4, float4 and float8 respectively.</li>
  <li>(DP) Updated to use PostgreSQL v6.5 system table structure.</li>
  <li>(DP) Implemented new 'About Box' with links to the Primary Website and
          the author's email address.</li>
  <li>(DP) Designed a new splash screen.</li>
  <li>(DP) The Table &amp; Index browsers now display extra info on the datasource
    including DBMS, Platform and Compiler.</li>
  <li>(DP) Improved the error logging (again!) and fixed the kooky logic where the
    code tried to log some queries after the program had crashed!</li>
</ul>
    <h4>v6.4.3 Fixes/Updates</h4>
<ul>
  <li>(DP) Added a PRIMARY KEY option to the table creation dialog.</li>
  <li>(DP) Changed the grid control to individual text boxes for the object
          details on all object browser dialogues.</li>
  <li>(DP) Added more sane default sizing to various dialogues.</li>
  <li>(DP) Added browsers and creation dialogues for Languages,&nbsp; Functions
          and Triggers (thanks to Vadim Mikheev for pointing me in the right
          direction with the Triggers).</li>
  <li>(DP) Added comment/notation facilities to most objects via the relevant
          browser dialogue (thanks to David Hartwig for that idea).</li>
  <li>(DP) Improved the error handling in the Tables Browser.</li>
  <li>(DP) Improved the efficiency of the object detail retrieval code in most
          of the browser dialogues.</li>
  <li>(DP) Added 'Number of Triggers' field to Table Details.</li>
  <li>(DP) Added a 'Logging' option to the File menu, that when selected, logs
          all SQL queries, form load events etc. to pgAdmin.log which now
          replaces the old pgErr.log file.</li>
  <li>(DP) Settings for View ButtonBar and Open Maximised are now store in the
          registry on a per user basis.</li>
</ul>
    <h4>v6.4.2 Fixes/Updates</h4>
<ul>
  <li>(DP) Improved the error logging to include details of the database
          connection and some internal variables in the logfile.</li>
  <li>(DP) Added a check to prevent use with earlier&nbsp; versions of
          PostgreSQL than are compatible.</li>
  <li>(DP) Added checks to warn the user if the ODBC driver settings for the
          datasource could cause problems with the operation of pgAdmin.</li>
  <li>(DP) Added a Database browser dialogue with Create and Drop database
          facilities.</li>
</ul>
    <h4>v6.4.1 Fixes/Updates</h4>
<ul>
  <li>(DP) SQL statements are now quoted where applicable. This allows the use
          of upper and lower case class/column names and spaces in class/column
          names.</li>
  <li>(DP) Fixed a bug in the import &amp; export wizards where under certain
          circumstances it was possible to attempt to open 2 files with the same
          handle.</li>
  <li>(DP) Re-implemented the Modify User dialogue. Thanks to DeJuan Jackson
          for kicking my brain into gear on that one!</li>
  <li>(DP) Updated the Table and Index&nbsp; browsers to get the column length
          in the same way that 'psql' does.</li>
  <li>(DP) Updated the privileges dialogue so it refreshes and doesn't close
          when you apply privileges.</li>
  <li>(DP) Made major changes to the Migration Wizard:</li>
  <li>(DP) Options to ignore/include DEFAULT and NOT NULL rules.</li>
  <li>(DP) Save Log button added to save the status log to file.</li>
  <li>(DP) Non-alphanumeric characters are now supported in class &amp;
         attribute names.</li>
  <li>(DP) Fixed a bug where Migration would fail if an attempt to migrate
         data from an empty table was made.</li>
</ul>
    <h4>v6.4.0 Fixes/Updates</h4>
<ul>
  <li>(DP) Fixed a bug in the setup program which failed to install DAO350.dll
          if the DAO path on a machine was a UNC path.</li>
  <li>(DP) Modified the global error logging to display the error number and
          message in the message box. Previously it only stated that an error
          had occured and it had logged it the error log.</li>
  <li>(DP) Recompiled all components under VB6.0 to remove any requirement for
          MSVBVM50.dll.</li>
  <li>(DP) Updated to use PostgreSQL v6.4 system table structure.</li>
  <li>(DP) Removed the Modify User options as this functionality no longer
          seems possible under v6.4 of PostgreSQL due to the permissions on the
          pg_shadow table.</li>
  <li>(DP) Fixed a bug which caused the error logging control to log errors
          with a code of zero raised by some really stupid Microsoft controls.</li>
</ul>
    <h4>v6.3.209 Fixes/Updates</h4>
<ul>
  <li>(DP) Fixed a bug which missed out the '-' in \CONNECT statements in
          scripts generated by the revision tracker.</li>
  <li>(DP) Fixed a bug whereby the Migration Wizard failed to function if the
          source database was an MS Access .mdb with password protection.</li>
  <li>(DP) Added the rExec facility. This may be used to execute commands on
          the remote host such as pg_dump.</li>
  <li>(DP) Moved the Revision Tracking menu/side bar options to the System
          menu/side bar.</li>
  <li>(DP) Vastly improved error handling. All trapable errors should now be
          either handled as appropriate or logged to C:\pgErr.log for debugging
          followed by a clean exit from the subroutine or function, not the
          whole program.</li>
</ul>
    <h4>v6.3.208 Fixes/Updates</h4>
<ul>
  <li>(DP) Fixed a bug where using the cancel button on the login form caused
          an error.</li>
  <li>(DP) Fixed the 'vanishing menu bug' where the main menu vanished whenever
          the Table Browser form had focus.</li>
  <li>(DP) We are now compiling under Visual Studio 6.0 which vastly improves
          the redistribution of MDAC (Microsoft Data Access Components) which
          should help reduce ODBC version conflict errors.</li>
</ul>
    <h4>v6.3.207 Fixes/Updates</h4>
<ul>
  <li>(DP) Added Revision Tracking. This feature logs all modifications made to
          your schema against the last release version number and allows easy
          production of SQL scripts to upgrade other systems.</li>
  <li>(DP) Added Sequence browser/creator.</li>
  <li>(DP) Started adding context sensitive menus to some controls.</li>
</ul>
    <h4>v6.3.206 Fixes/Updates</h4>
<ul>
  <li>(DP) The textboxes on the login dialog now automatically select their
          contents when they get focus.</li>
  <li>(DP) Updated the Import &amp; Migration Wizards so that they will not try
          to insert null values into columns - each column will only be included
          in the SQL Insert string if it contains data.</li>
  <li>(DP) The default Type Map used by the Migration Wizard can now be
          configured as required, and will be stored in the registry. The Type
          Map is used to determine what column type to create in PostgreSQL for
          a given DAO type - eg. dbLongBinary -&gt; lo</li>
</ul>
    <h4>v6.3.205 Fixes/Updates</h4>
<ul>
  <li>(DP) The Migration Wizard will now automatically skip tables with spaces
          in their names and data transfers of large binary objects.</li>
  <li>(DP) Missing tooltips added and tab order fixed on the Migration Wizard.</li>
</ul>
    <h4>v6.3.204 Fixes/Updates</h4>
<ul>
  <li>(DP) Version numbers synchronised with PostgresSQL. eg. Currently rev 4
          for PostgreSQL 6.3.2</li>
  <li>(DP) Added Bug Report/Feature Request Tool.</li>
  <li>(DP) Added 'Open Maximised' menu item to default all child windows to
          open maximised.</li>
  <li>(DP) Changed Add Table/Column tools to allow no size specification for
          text fields etc.</li>
  <li>(DP) New splash screen by Robert Page (<a href="mailto:rob@mindzone.demon.co.uk">rob@beta-band.freeserve.co.uk</a>,
    <a href="http://www.beta-band.freeserve.co.uk" target="_top">http://www.beta-band.freeserve.co.uk</a> 
          ).</li>
  <li>(DP) Added menu option to change the current database.</li>
  <li>(DP) Arbitary SQL queries can now be saved in the registry for each datasource.</li>
  <li>(DP) Added Access/ODBC Migration Wizard.</li>
</ul>
    <h4>v1.0.3 Fixes/Updates</h4>
<ul>
  <li>(DP) The MSysConf table is now created if required if it does not already
          exist, with default values.</li>
  <li>(DP) A user manager has been added, allowing the creation, maintenance
          and deletion of users. Note that passwords cannot be set for password
          lists other than the pg_shadow table.</li>
  <li>(DP) Added a text box to the Create Table dialog to enable the
          specification of the column length for varchars etc. (which I somehow
          forgot!).</li>
  <li>(DP) The Privileges dialog can now REVOKE as well as GRANT privileges.</li>
</ul>
    <h4>v1.0.2 Fixes/Updates</h4>
<ul>
  <li>(DP) Default column values are now shown in the Table browser (thanks to
          Antonio Garcia Mari for working out the SQL for me).</li>
  <li>(DP) The import wizard now handles columns with CRLF in them EXCEPT if it
          is the last column in the record, and the data is delimited only
          without a trailing delimiter. All data is imported where possible,
          records with errors are discarded and logged to c:\pgAdmin.log with as
          much information about the error as possible.</li>
  <li>(DP) Tooltips are now in place for most objects.</li>
  <li>(DP) The Export wizard will now warn before overwriting a file.</li>
</ul>
